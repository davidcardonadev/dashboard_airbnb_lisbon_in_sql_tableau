2. **Calendar:** Provides information on the availability and pricing of Airbnb listings for specific dates.
3. **Reviews:** Contains reviews from guests who have stayed at Airbnb listings, including ratings and comments.

## Data Processing

2. **Cleaning:** SQL was used to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the three datasets.
3. **Enrichment:** Additional data on Lisbon neighborhoods' zip codes was incorporated from an external dataset to enable geographical analysis in Tableau. [www.listendata.com](https://www.listendata.com/2020/11/zip-code-to-latitude-and-longitude.html)
